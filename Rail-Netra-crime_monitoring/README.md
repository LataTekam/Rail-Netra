# Rail-Netra (CrimeDetection): Detecting the criminal activities in CCTV videos

## Overview: 
In this project we used the deep learning techniques like CNN and LSTM to identify the activities in a video. 
If a criminal activity is found then the clip is cut out and stored to the firebase.
The generated clip is stored along with other information i.e. accuracy, crime_type, time-date
An alert message is sent to the respective authority using our flutter Mobile App

## Technology used: 
* Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
* Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)
* OpenCV
* Keras
* NumPy
* Python
* Deep Learning
* Firebase Admin 
* Google Colab
